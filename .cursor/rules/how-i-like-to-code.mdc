# Coding Workflow Preferences for Cursor

## Focus on Task-Relevant Code
- **Concentrate on Relevant Areas:**  
  Modify only the sections of the code that are directly related to the task at hand. Avoid touching parts of the codebase that are unrelated to prevent unintended side effects.

## Comprehensive Testing
- **Write Thorough Tests:**  
  Ensure that every major functionality is covered by tests. Integrate test writing as part of the workflow to avoid overlooking critical functionality.

## Stability in Implementation
- **Preserve Existing Patterns:**  
  Avoid making major changes to established patterns and architecture unless explicitly requested. Stick to proven methods to maintain stability.

- **Modify Instead of Rewriting:**  
  When addressing an issue, adjust the existing code rather than rewriting it from scratch with new patterns. This minimizes disruption and preserves code consistency.

## Impact Awareness
- **Evaluate Dependency Effects:**  
  Always consider how changes might affect other parts of the code. Assess dependencies and potential impacts to ensure that modifications donâ€™t break related functionality.

## Clear and Focused Changes
- **Follow Specific Instructions:**  
  Implement changes only as specified in the request. Provide detailed instructions when necessary to ensure that only the intended parts of the code are modified.
